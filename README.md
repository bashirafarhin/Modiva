# Clothing Store Project
This project is a responsive clothing store website inspired by H&M. It is built using HTML, CSS, and React. While this is not a clone of H&M, it incorporates similar design elements and functionalities.

## Overview
* Responsive Design: The website adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes.
* Technologies Used:
 1. HTML: For structuring the content.
 2. CSS: For styling and layout.
 3. React: For building interactive user interfaces.

## Performance Note
Please note that the website may appear slow, as it was developed before I learned about using Redux for state management.
